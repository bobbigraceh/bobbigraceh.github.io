        <h2>1st Step: Admitting you need to delete yourself</h2>
        <p>
            The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. Unfortunately some problems tend to blow up and might make you feel like there's no way out. Fortunately for you, there's a way out, and that is to delete yourself.
        <p>


        <div class="row column text">
        <h2>2nd Step: Taking the next steps</h2>
        <p>
              Now that you've accepted you have a problem and need to delete yourself, you're ready. In order to do so, you need to practice. Grab your phone or your ocmputer, which ever one is closest to you, pull up the keyboard and practice hitting the delete button. It might take a few times before you become adjusted to this fact, but practice makes perfect.
        <p>



        <div class="row column text">
        <h2>3rd Step: Deleting yourself</h2>
        <p>
              You've come to terms with it and have perfected the act of deletion. Now all that's left, is time. Though the self-deletion feeling usually speeds this process up since you want to remove yourself from this problem. So here are my last words to you-delete yourself.
